This project demonstrates how different algorithmic strategies can be applied to real-world problems. The notebook includes implementations, performance profiling, and complexity analysis for each problem. The strategies covered include Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, and Brute Force.
It contains two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating core algorithmic concepts using practical, real-world problems. Together, they cover Greedy algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Brute Force, and Graph Algorithms with performance analysis.
