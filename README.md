Algorithm Efficiency Mini Project
Analyzing Time & Space Complexity Through Real Experiments
This project measures and compares the performance of several classic algorithms used in computer science.
It includes:
Sorting Algorithms
Fibonacci (Recursive vs Dynamic Programming)
Binary Search
Time & Memory Profiling
Visual Graphs and Summary Tables
The goal is to experimentally validate Big-O complexity using real execution time and memory usage.



Algorithm Strategies Mini-Project
Solving Real-World Problems with Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking & Brute Force

This project demonstrates how different algorithmic strategies can be applied to real-world problems—from scheduling TV commercials to cracking passwords.
Each section includes working Python implementations, visualizations, and performance insights.



Graph Algorithms Mini-Project
Solving Real-World Problems Using BFS, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra & Prim's MST

This project demonstrates how graph algorithms solve real-life challenges in social networks, navigation systems, emergency response, and infrastructure planning.
Each problem includes Python implementations, performance profiling, and graph visualizations.
